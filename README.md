Hideout Server's Stardew Valley Modpack

Open the "Install me FIRST" folder and install SMAPI, if it can't find your game folder just point it towards
where your game pass installation is, game pass usually causes this error and it's located at "Xbox\Stardew Valley\Content"

Drag and drop the "Mods" folder into your main stardew valley game folder where you chose to install SMAPI.

Enjoy!
